# Environmental Data Processing & Git Setup

## Overview

Meeting with MK & CR to set up github connection in R & start with environmental data processing.


## Github Setup
* Walked through structure of github repo
* Setup notebook post system for tracking analysis
* Integrated git with MK's Rstudio

## Environmental Data Processing
* Working with MK to start more in depth processing
* daily mins/maxes/averages

What do we want for these data?
* daily trends, i.e. calculate summary stats for each day split from larger df, then look at trends
  * we could potentially do this by adding a column for day and then grouping based on that
* degree days above some temperature
