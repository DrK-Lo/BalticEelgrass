I have dug up some actual monitoring data from 27 stations over mostly 30 years along the Swedish coastline, am compiling that in relation to our sampling sites and also comparing it to actually logged data at several meadows. I will send more details in the coming days!

As the same time I have also talked with people what models are best for the current and predicted environment, and yes the best is probably to use a similar model to https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/BALTICSEA_MULTIYEAR_PHY_003_011/description?. Per Jonsson has worked with a very similar one in the project ClimeMarine that models temperature and salinity for 30 year windows, and that would therefore probably the best for consistent estimates for past and future for a specific spatial position. However, this data might actually not be publicly accessible right now, but Per would be happy to retrieve the relevant data for our sites. So my question is now what you feel that relevant data is? Mean, max, min and range for summer salinity and temperature (June, July and August)? Or what environmental variables and for what time-scales/-points did you and would you like to use for the GEA?

I agree that it is so important to chose the right environmental data source and be consistent with what we use in GEA, as treatments in the mesocosms etc, so it is an interesting exercise for my sanity to look at the differences in the different data-sources.
